# Rocket Collider Docs
Hello! This is my personal github to collect projects I wish to share with the public. All the code on here is my own.

## Who Is Behind rocketcollider
I'm an Austrian programmer looking for hire. This is where I showcase some of my projects. You can contact me with work-proposals here:

If you want my attention, use cryptography!

## What's Different About rocketcollider?
Verry little. I'm your average skilled programmer, but I live for tests, documentation and readable code.
My code is comprehensible, readable, documented and relible thanks to test driven development.

I simply enjoy it. Usability is part of every project. Documentation is essential for usability. Tests enable reliable documentation.

Apart from that, there is very little specialisation. I'm most experienced with python, but learning new languages is a pastime of mine (currently improving Fortran).
My time to work productiven in a new language is below 2 weeks.

## Any Other Talents?
Running QubesOS productively on my machines, contributed some documentation to the project.

Finished my MSc in physics with high honours, still doing some side-projects in that area.

Hard to quantify "affinity to security". Never worked in that area, but I can think in attack-scenarios, exposure-minimisation and understanding cryptography-schemes.
